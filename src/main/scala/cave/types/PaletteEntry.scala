   * The CAVE first-generation hardware handles transparency the following way:
   *
   * If the color code is zero the pixel is transparent. This results in 15 usable colors for a
   * tile. Even if the color at the first index of the palette is not zero, the pixel is still
   * transparent.
   *
   * It is difficult to understand why CAVE didn't use the MSB bit of the 16 bit color word to
   * indicate transparency. This would allow for 16 colors out of 2^15 colors for each tile instead
   * of 15 colors of 2^15. With the CAVE CV1000 (SH3) hardware, they use the MSB bit of the 16-bit
   * word as a transparency bit, while the colors remain RGB555.
   *
   * One wonders why they didn't do this on first-generation hardware.
